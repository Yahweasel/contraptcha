                <h2>What is this???</h2>

                <p>This is Contraptcha, the word game no one asked for!</p>

                <p>
                    (WARNING: These images are AI generated. Some may be racist,
                    erotic, troubling, or anything else.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Contraptcha is a word puzzle inspired by AI-generated art
                    and CAPTCHAs. In this game, you're presented with four
                    images, each drawn by AI from the same prompt. The prompt is
                    simply a sequence of English nouns. Every time you find one
                    of the words, that's removed from the prompt, so you see the
                    images generated with one word less.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your goal is, of course, to find every word. If you enter a
                    word that's not part of the prompt, a “semantic similarity”
                    will be shown for whichever word it's most similar to. The
                    semantic similarity is simply a number describing the
                    similarity in concept between the word you entered and the
                    word that's in the prompt. Higher is more similar, and the
                    range is from 0–99, though it's quite rare to go above 70.
                    For instance, if the word is “space” and you enter “stars”,
                    you'll get a high semantic similarity, whereas if the word
                    is “pig” and you enter “stars”, you'll get a low semantic
                    similarity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're stumped and want more hints, you have two options
                    available: (1) You can show how the images would be generated
                    without any of the words you don't know by clicking the
                    word's guess box (the question marks), or by entering a
                    number from 1–6. Remember, what you're doing is
                    <em>removing</em> a word, so if you remove word 4 and the
                    stars disappear from the image, that means word 4 probably
                    <em>is</em> star or stars! (2) You can let the game guess a
                    random word for you by clicking the “hint” button or typing
                    “/hint”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Remember: AI is stupid and bad at everything, so you may
                    have to think outside the box.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's currently no scoring system, but basically, as few
                    guesses as possible is what you want, right? Both of the
                    hint systems can probably be considered cheats, and when/if
                    a scoring system is made, using them will count against you.
